# Use Arduino + DS18B20 to measure temperature
### Download https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library.git 
### and add the library to your Arduino IDE

### You may also need to add OneWire library
[Download OneWire library](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/one-wire "OneWire")

### And finally, update /script/temperature/temperature.ino to your Arduino
DS18B20 data pin (the middle one) connect to Arduino D2 pin
